# KnowBot

### Discord bot to provide progressively intelligent assistance to Elixir/Phoenix learners participating in the DockYard Academy.

## Vision

Ultimately, KnowBot should be able to "listen in" on conversations in DockYard Academy text channels and provide answers to the questions being asked in the conversations. This involves natural language processing (NLP) functionality that is beyond the scope of an initial release (MVP -- or "MVB" in this case).

## MVB (Minimal Viable Bot) Functionality

To make KnowBot immediately useful, the initial functionality starts with: 
  * /H (or help or HELP) - How to use this bot
  * /faq (or FAQ) - Get the (evolving) FAQ content - starting with links to HexDocs, and (especially) resources that are optimized for Elixir learners. This should evolve rapidly, so keep trying.
  * /q (or /Q): Ask a question
